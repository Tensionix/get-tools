"""The stand of the window: a Debug window without a screen and a door that only pretends.

    runtime\\python.exe Source\\Tools\\stand.py

It starts `Source\\bin\\Debug\\net10.0\\AudionGetTools.exe -Stand <folder>` (build it first:
`dotnet build Source\\AudionGetTools.csproj -c Debug`), waits for it and prints what the window
saw - a run, STOP by the signal, a forced STOP after its term, a command that left a process
behind, a tool left running on purpose (Source\\MainWindow.Stand.cs). Then it looks at the one
thing the window cannot see: whether the tool left on its own is alive once the window is gone.
Everything the stand left running is ended here, by the ids the processes wrote themselves.

The folder of the stand is a temporary one outside the program; nothing of the program is
written to. The exit code is 0 when every check passed, 1 otherwise.
