title Audion Get Tools - Build App

rem Builds App\ from Source\: the window of the program, AudionGetTools.exe, and the
rem PowerShell 7 it carries, AudionPs.exe (the console menus, the command line of the
rem terminal and the scripts of the builder run with it).
rem
rem Self-contained for win-x64: App\ carries its own .NET runtime, so the program
rem runs on a machine with nothing installed. The new copy is put together in
rem ._runtime\app_stage and checked there; App\ is replaced only by a copy that is
rem whole, so a failed build leaves the working one in place. The version comes
rem from config\version.json - the project file reads it - and is written into the
rem executable.
rem
rem The checks of the window run first: the door of the engine and the layout
rem (tests\test_cli_door.py), and the dictionary of the window - every Russian text
rem it shows has its English pair (tests\test_window_i18n.py). The built copy then
rem checks itself (--self-test): the answer of the door reads, every place of an
rem operation has its node and its fields; --just-built adds that the number of the
rem executable is the number of config\version.json. A release does not ask that
rem of its window: the engine moves on from version to version, and App\ is
rem rebuilt only when Source\ changes.
rem
rem Needs the .NET 10 SDK and the Python of the project (builder_main.cmd, step 02).
rem
rem Usage: install\Build-App.cmd [/NOPAUSE]
